# Component Upgrade Summary

## Overview

All Blade components have been upgraded according to the migration rules. The following changes were made:

1. Moved all components to appropriate subfolders.
2. Renamed component references in all Blade templates to follow the new naming convention.
3. Ensured no files remain in the root components folder.
4. Created an upgrade script for future reference.

## Component Naming Convention

Components are now organized under the following structure:

- **Input Components**: `<x-input.*>`
  - Example: `<x-input.input>`, `<x-input.form>`, `<x-input.select>`

- **UI Components**: `<x-ui.*>`
  - Example: `<x-ui.button>`, `<x-ui.card>`, `<x-ui.modal>`

- **Layout Components**: `<x-layout.*>`
  - Example: `<x-layout.app>`, `<x-layout.heading>`, `<x-layout.text>`

- **Data Components**: `<x-data.*>`
  - Example: `<x-data.table>`, `<x-data.table.row>`, `<x-data.table.cell>`

- **Authentication Components**: `<x-auth.*>`
  - Example: `<x-auth.auth-header>`, `<x-auth.auth-session-status>`

- **Feedback Components**: `<x-feedback.*>`
  - Example: `<x-feedback.error>`, `<x-feedback.alert>`, `<x-feedback.action-message>`

## Component Files Structure

Components are organized in a nested directory structure:

```
resources/views/components/
├── auth/
├── data/
├── feedback/
├── input/
├── layout/
├── settings/
└── ui/
```

Each directory contains component files related to that specific category.
