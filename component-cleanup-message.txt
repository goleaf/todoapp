refactor: complete Blade component reorganization

This commit completes the reorganization of Blade components by:

1. Removing all duplicate component files from category root directories
2. Creating proper subdirectory structure for all components
3. Implementing consistent index.blade.php pattern throughout

Special enhancements:
- Added app.blade.php and index.blade.php to layout/app/ directory
- Added auth.blade.php and index.blade.php to layout/auth/ directory 
- Created proper subdirectories for auth/auth-header and auth/auth-session-status
- Ensured no components remain in any category root directory

This change ensures a more maintainable and consistent component structure
where all components follow the same organization pattern, making the codebase
easier to navigate and understand.
