## Component Structure

The component structure now follows a consistent pattern:
- Total blade components: 137
- All components use `@props` declarations
- Component references follow standard naming conventions

## Testing Recommendations

1. Thoroughly test the following pages for correct functioning:
   - Dashboard page
   - Todo listing and operations
   - Any pages that use forms or cards
   - Pagination functionality

2. Check that all components render correctly with the applied styles and layouts

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. Always maintain a consistent component naming convention
2. Use the component check tool regularly to identify missing references
3. Update the component structure when adding new components
4. Keep a backup of the original components in case of issues
